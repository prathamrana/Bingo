# Bingo
This program was coded in Java. This program creates a random bingo board from 75 numbers and keeps on playing bingo by itself and prints out the numbers being called as well as the board being updated, until the program finds a bingo either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. At the end of the program, it states how many tries it took.
